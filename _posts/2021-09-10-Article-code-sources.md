[Yandex is the latest big commercial organization to sustain a major distributed denial-of-service incident, Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/technology/russias-yandex-says-it-repelled-biggest-ddos-attack-history-2021-09-09/). The Russian multinational tech firm says it successfully parried the attack.

Researchers at **Broadcom's Symantec unit** attribute the campaign using the **SideWalk malware** **ESET described late last month** to the Chinese **Grayfly cyberespionage group**. SideWalk is a **modular backdoor** that's recently been used against telecom providers. (Grayfly is also known as **Wicked Panda** or **APT41**.)

**AT&T Alien Labs** finds that the criminal group **TeamTNT** is using a difficult-to-detect version of **Chimaera** in a campaign of credential theft and cryptojacking.

**Digital Shadows** subjects the revived version of the contraband market **AlphaBay** to analysis and concludes that, while there's an underworld opportunity for a revival, the latest edition may have trouble building on the original marketplace's street cred. Potential users suspect the new AlphaBay's admin may be compromised and they mistrust the absence of **exit-scam protection**.

Zoho has patched its ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus against an authentication bypass vulnerability that's currently being exploited in the wild. CISA urges users to apply the fix.

Researchers at **McAfee and Intel471** jointly describe a "shake-up" in the criminal-to-criminal ransomware affiliate market being led by the **Groove Gang**. Whereas earlier ransomware-as-a-service programs had prioritized control over the code and a systematically hierarchical organization of the affiliates, the Groove Gang is proving more fluid and opportunistic. It prizes not the affiliates' skills, but simply their networks.

Avast describes a new underworld offering: Instagram-bans-as-a-service. You can ban or harass someone for just $50.
