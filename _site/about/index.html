  <h2>Practicing Security online</h2>
   <p>If you discover and sign up for new services around the web, you will have a collection of passwords after a short while. How you manage these passwords affects the privacy and security of your information online. </p>

  <p>Do you use a password management tool? Or store your passwords in your browser? How do you get information on making your passwords more secure and yet still convenient to use when you are online? Securaware is aimed at helping users identify how they're using passwords and how to improve their online security.</p>

  <p>Taking more time on security, by using a stronger password or using another authentication step, can take more time wheen you are accessing websites so there can be resistance based on the perception of inconvenience and extra time.</p>

  <h2>Learn about passwords</h2>
	<p>What are some things that you could do to improve your online safety? Making passwords harder for people to crack or guess helps keep your online account safer.</p>

   <p>What are the sources you trust for information about online security? Is it friends, family or an organization you belong to? Try to have a conversation with a friend or family member to compare how they handle passwords, and also check online for the latest information.</p>

  <p>There are free resources from governments and organizations online that you can consult for ideas on improving password security. For example, in the United States, <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002">a government agency will publish tips</a> on password security that anyone can view and make use of. You might want to learn about multi-factor management, which many websites are asking users to enable to protect their accounts.</p>

   <h2>Thinking about security</h2>
	<p>Spending time on reviewing your online security is a good habit to get into as a way of protecting your personal information online. Even if you think the risk is low of your personal information being stolen, it's good to check the virtual doors and windows to ensure your digital "home" is secure or find areas you might want to fix. </p>

   <p>While it is a choice to spend money on tools, or use one of the many free tools that are available, the first step is just setting aside 10 minutes to do some research on security steps like creating stronger passwords. </p>

  <p> Practicing will help reduce that extra time, and it will become easier. At the end of the day, it is an investment in protecting yourself and avoiding the loss of data if your passwords get leaked or hacked.</p>
